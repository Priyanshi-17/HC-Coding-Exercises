# Exercise 1 - Design Patterns Implementation

## Overview

This project demonstrates six use cases of software design patterns implemented in Java as part of an academic assignment. The focus is on showcasing understanding and practical application of different categories of design patterns.

## Design Patterns Covered

- *Behavioral Patterns*
  - Observer Pattern: Implemented a news notification system.
  - Strategy Pattern: Demonstrated payment system with interchangeable methods.

- *Creational Patterns*
  - Singleton Pattern: Logger utility to ensure single instance.
  - Factory Pattern: Shape creation factory producing different shapes.

- *Structural Patterns*
  - Adapter Pattern: Audio player supporting multiple formats via adapter.
  - Composite Pattern: Company employee hierarchy using composite design.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with one Java file per pattern use case for clarity and modularity:

| File Name                   | Pattern Type    | Description                               |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------ |
| ObserverPatternDemo.java    | Behavioral      | News notification system                  |
| StrategyPatternDemo.java    | Behavioral      | Payment method system                     |
| SingletonPatternDemo.java   | Creational      | Logger singleton implementation           |
| FactoryPatternDemo.java     | Creational      | Factory pattern for shape creation        |
| AdapterPatternDemo.java     | Structural      | Audio player with adapter support         |
| CompositePatternDemo.java   | Structural      | Company hierarchy implemented as composite|

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the folder in an IDE like VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Compile and run any of the Java files individually to see the corresponding design pattern in action.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Mastery of key design patterns covering behavioral, creational, and structural categories.
- Adherence to SOLID principles and clean code design.
- Practical experience writing modular and maintainable Java code using industry best practices.
